# 🎮 Hangman Game in C

## 📝 Project Description
This is a simple Hangman word guessing game written in the C programming language.  
It was created as a beginner-level project to practice loops, conditional statements, and arrays.  

## In the game:
- The computer stores a secret word.
- The player guesses one letter at a time.
- Each wrong guess reduces the number of lives.
- The player wins if they guess all letters before running out of lives.

## Concepts Used

C Programming Concepts
- **Loops** (`for`, `while`)  
- **Conditional statements** (`if-else`)  
- **Character arrays (strings)**  
- **Functions** (custom function for checking guesses)  
- **User input with `scanf()`**  
- **String handling using `<string.h>` and `<ctype.h>`**

Maths Concepts
- **Counting logic:keeping track of correct and wrong guesses  
- **Condition checking:using comparisons to validate letters and lives
